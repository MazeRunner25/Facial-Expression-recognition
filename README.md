# Facial-Expression-recognition
step 1:
Build and train a CNN model in Keras to recognize seven facial expressions.<br>
step 2:
Use OpenCV to automatically detect faces(Facial Recognition)in the images by drawing square boxes around them,use Flask to build a web application which performs real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.This is done in the files camera.py and main.py .<br>
step 3:
Create model class to predict the expressions by loading the model from json file and by loading weights . This is done in model.py file.
