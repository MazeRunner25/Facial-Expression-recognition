# Facial-Expression-recognition
step 1:
Build and train a CNN model in Keras to recognize seven facial expressions.<br>
step 2:
Use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images by drawing square boxes around them.<br>
step3
Use Flask to build a web application which performs real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
